ResouceControllerRespondTo
==========================

Extends ResourceController plugin for Rails to make it respond_to .xml and .json formats

ResourceController URL: http://github.com/giraffesoft/resource_controller/
This plugin URL:        http://github.com/jesperronn/resource_controller_respond_to/ 



Example
=======

Just drop this in your plugins folder.                     
Also, make sure this plugin is loaded AFTER ResourceController

You may also want to add the following line to your environment.rb -- in case it's not working
config.plugins = [ :resource_controller, :resource_controller_respond_to, :all ]




Based on code by Florent Piteau and Joe Fiorini... Jesper merely provided the glue and packed as plugin.
